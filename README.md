# AI & ML Compendium for Power Systems

An authoritative compendium of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) resources for the Bulk Power System (BPS) and utility sector.

As a Professional Engineer (PE, Power) and Enterprise Architect, I found it difficult to find a centralized, high-quality list of modern AI/ML resources specific to the power systems domain. This repository is my effort to create that resource.

This list is intended for engineers, data scientists, and leaders working on grid modernization, renewable integration, load forecasting, and predictive maintenance.

Contributions are welcome.
